    <h1>San Francisco's Fight Against Drug/Narcotic</h1>
    <p>One significant factor contributing to this decline could be improvements in law enforcement strategies and community policing efforts. Over the years, law enforcement agencies in San Francisco may have implemented targeted interventions, crime prevention programs, and proactive policing tactics aimed at reducing crime rates.</p>

        <p style="font-color: gray; font-size: 8px;"> though we don't have the data for June-December for 2018, it's clear that the trend is downwards for the last few years</p>

    <p>Furthermore, advancements in technology and the use of data analytics may have played a role in crime reduction initiatives. Law enforcement agencies could have leveraged technology to improve crime mapping, predictive modeling, and real-time crime monitoring, allowing for more efficient deployment of resources and strategic interventions to deter criminal activity.</p>
    <p>Changes in socio-economic conditions and community development programs may have also contributed to the decrease in crime rates. Efforts to address poverty, unemployment, and inequality, as well as investments in education, affordable housing, and social services, can have a positive impact on crime prevention by addressing underlying social determinants of criminal behavior.</p>

    <p>Our exploration focuses on several key substances that have notably influenced the city's drug landscape: cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, prescription drugs and marijuana. Of these, cocaine stood out for its significant presence, underscoring a nationwide concern that spans years. However, a clear trend of a steady decline in incidents involving these substances can be observed. This downward trajectory suggests a combination of successful law enforcement strategies, community engagement, and possibly, changes in drug usage behaviors. TRY TO FIND SOURCES</p>


    <p>A particularly intriguing aspect of San Francisco's drug narrative is the story of marijuana. Once a major driver of drug-related incidents, marijuana's path reflects a broader shift in societal attitudes and legal frameworks. The legalization of marijuana in California, marked by Proposition 64 in 2016, catalyzed a dramatic shift, not just in legal terms but also in its impact on drug incident reports. Post-legalization, the data hints at a diminished role for marijuana in the city's drug incident landscape, likely due to the removal of legal penalties for possession and use, coupled with regulated access.</p>.
